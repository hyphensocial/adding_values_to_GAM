Hyphensocial's Adding Value to GAM Script

Please follow the initial instructions found [HERE](https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/api/start#python) in order to get the JSON credential file required to get started.
Once that json file is created for your user, please save that json to a secure location, since that json is equivalent to a user login. 

From there, please provide the appropriate parameters for the main function found in the repository. Once the script finishes, all values provided from the id_values_list param will be added to your GAM account, and any values not present will be removed
